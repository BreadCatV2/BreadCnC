# SocketServer

This Project is just a small attempt at making a Server to handle multiple socket connections easily and platform independent

## Project Structure

The Project is divided into 2 parts, the Client and the Server. The Client is just a simple program that connects to the Server and sends a simple message to it. The Server is the main part of the project and is responsible for handling multiple connections.

## Client

The Client is a simple program that connects to the server and makes the Server able to remotley manage the target machine. It is written in Java and uses the Socket class.

## Server

The Server is the main part of the project and is responsible for handling multiple connections. It is written in NodeJS and uses the net module.

## Building

### Client

The Client will be built in Java and uses the [Socket](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html) class to create a new Socket and connect to the Server. It uses the [connect](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#connect(java.net.SocketAddress)) method to connect to the Server and the [getOutputStream](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#getOutputStream()) method to get the OutputStream of the Socket. The Client is built using IntelliJ IDEA.

### Server

The Server is built in NodeJS and uses the [net](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) module to create a new Server and handle multiple connections. It uses the [createServer](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_net_createserver_options_connectionlistener) method to create a new Server and the [on](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_emitter_on_eventname_listener) method to handle the [connection](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_event_connection) event. The Server is built using Visual Studio Code.
